Plagiarism Detection Website:

A web-based plagiarism detection system that checks textual similarity using OCR, text processing, and online source comparison. This project emphasizes academic integrity and demonstrates the practical use of data structures and web technologies.

Features:-

 Text Input – Users can directly paste text for plagiarism checking
 
 Image Upload – Extracts text from images using OCR (Tesseract)
 
 Online Source Matching – Compares content with web sources
 
 Plagiarism Percentage – Displays similarity score
 
 Source Identification – Shows the main matched online source
 
 Responsive UI – Works on mobile and desktop devices
 
 Cloud Deployed – Hosted live using Render

Tech Stack:-

Frontend:HTML5 & CSS3 (Responsive Design)

Backend:Python & Flask Framework

Core Technologies:

1.OCR: Tesseract OCR

2.Text Similarity: N-grams & Jaccard Similarity

3.Web Search: SerpAPI (REST API)

4.Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup

Deployment:

GitHub (Version Control)

Render (Cloud Hosting)


How It Works:-

User uploads an image or enters text

If image is uploaded:

Text is extracted using OCR

Text is cleaned and processed

N-grams are generated

Online sources are fetched using search API

Similarity is calculated using Jaccard similarity

Plagiarism percentage and source are displayed

 Algorithms & Data Structures Used:-

Sets – For n-gram comparison

Strings & Lists – Text preprocessing

Jaccard Similarity Algorithm – Similarity calculation

N-gram Analysis – Detecting overlapping phrases
